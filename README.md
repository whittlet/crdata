MBTA Commuter Rail Ridership Data

Some entries in the 2018 ridership data were blank, which I generally assumed should be zeros. However for Train 40, the math did not add up so I assumed the load numbers were correct; this meant filling in the blank entries for Whitman with 1 boarding and 1 alighting, and increasing the number of JFK/UMass alightings from 22 to 24.
